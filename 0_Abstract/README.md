# ABSTRACT
A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required manual wiper activation, and the operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult to manage. As a result, this method is proposed to address these issues. The project's goals are to improve ageing automobiles' systems by giving automated transmission. wiping system, to enhance the system by including a sensor and an actuator, and to create a simple software that would completely work with the system the framework.This proposed wiper system's principle is comparable to those of other existing conventional wipers
