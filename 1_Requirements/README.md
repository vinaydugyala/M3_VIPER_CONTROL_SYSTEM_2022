# DESCRIPTION
# STM32F407VG
The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded
# Xpack Packages :
Windows Build Tools: The xPack Windows Build Tools is a standalone Windows binary distribution of GNU make and a few of other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT (formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project, but the binaries can also be used in generic build environments.
# OpenOCD :
Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) is a free, open-source project that aims to provide debugging, in-system programming, and boundary scan using a debug adapter. The adapter is a hardware module that provides the right signals for the target to understand.
# QEMU :
The xPack QEMU Arm is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of QEMU, with several extensions for Arm Cortex-M devices.

# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
-> Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.

-> Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.

-> Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories.

-> 512 bytes of OTP memory.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE
Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)

# WHAT
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions. 

# WHEN
The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO
A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions

# WHERE
In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.

# HOW
You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
