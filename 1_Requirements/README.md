# COMPONENTS
-> STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD


# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
-> STM32 IDE

# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
-> Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.

-> Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.

-> Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories.

-> 512 bytes of OTP memory.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE
Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)

# WHAT
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions. 

# WHEN
The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO
A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions

# WHERE
In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.

# HOW
You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
