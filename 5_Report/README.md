# INTRODUCTION

## COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:

-> STM32F407 Discovery Board

-> Push Button

-> LEDs

-> Resistors

-> Power Supply
## ADVANTAGES:
-> To save money during wet seasons, turn off the irrigation system. Electricity bills are lowered as a consequence.

-> Rain sensors store water during rain events, allowing it to be available throughout the summer and winter.

-> As a consequence, rain sensor-based equipment like vehicle wipers and irrigation systems last longer since they only work when needed.

-> It is quite simple to use.

-> As a consequence, less energy is consumed.

-> Rain sensor-based systems are extremely simple to install.

-> Individual rain sensors are fairly inexpensive.
## DISADVANTAGES:
-> When water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.

-> The entire system cost rises when more components, including a rain sensor, are required.

-> Rain sensors must make a decision within a few minutes to avoid erroneous detection of rain.

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)
## WHAT
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.

## WHERE
In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.

## WHEN
The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

## WHO
A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions.

## HOW
You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
