# INTRODUCTION
Wiper is an essential component that is used to wipe raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper

The existing system uses a control stalk to activate the wiper and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult.r needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driver’s concentration during the driving. Thus, this system is proposed to solve all these problems. The concept of this wiper system is similar to other conventional wipers, yet this system will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a controller.When water hits a dedicated sensor located on the windscreen, it triggers the wiper motor to move. is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more concentration and reduce the car accident probability.

In this project, there were two innovations reviewed as the literature review. The two were designed with different concepts and operating mechanism however with same objective of working principle of the car wiper. The rain sensor was a highly versatile device for automatic wiping of vehicle windscreen when it is wet due to moisture, raindrops or even mud. It worked by reflecting harmonious light beams within the windscreen. When raindrops fall onto the windscreen, this harmony light is disturbed and creating a drop in the light beam intensity. The system then activated the wipers to be operated in full automatic mode. It has a response time of 0.1 seconds. It allowed for a quick reaction when it is a sudden splashes of water that will make the driver totally ‘blinds’ when the situation happened. With the automatic wiper, the driver can avert the risk of an accident. The automatic wiper is important during heavy traffic, e.g. in town, city, school zone and other public places. A driver may be subjected to many distractions with bad weather, dangerous road conditions and fatigue. The Rain Sensor reduced the driver’s burden by making driving more comfortable. Trailing a wet car is no longer a nuisance as detection of even 0.005 milliliters of water is possible.

## COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES:

-> STM32F407 Discovery Board

-> Push Button

-> LEDs

-> Resistors

-> Power Supply
## ADVANTAGES:
-> To save money during wet seasons, turn off the irrigation system. Electricity bills are lowered as a consequence.

-> Rain sensors store water during rain events, allowing it to be available throughout the summer and winter.

-> As a consequence, rain sensor-based equipment like vehicle wipers and irrigation systems last longer since they only work when needed.

-> It is quite simple to use.

-> As a consequence, less energy is consumed.

-> Rain sensor-based systems are extremely simple to install.

-> Individual rain sensors are fairly inexpensive.
## DISADVANTAGES:
-> When water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.

-> The entire system cost rises when more components, including a rain sensor, are required.

-> Rain sensors must make a decision within a few minutes to avoid erroneous detection of rain.

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)
## WHAT
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.

## WHERE
In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.

## WHEN
The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

## WHO
A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions.

## HOW
You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
